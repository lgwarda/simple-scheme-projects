# Programming Learning Resources

This repository contains my learning journey through various computer science resources, organized by programming language.

## Directory Structure

- `/racket`: Course materials and solutions related to Racket programming, including:
  - `/htdp2e`: Solutions for How to Design Programs, Second Edition.
  - `/simply-scheme`: Solutions for Simply Scheme.
  - `/algorithms`: Some solutions to intermediate algorithms.

### Future Improvements

In the near future, I plan to further organize resources and ensure each directory maintains its original commit history.

### Contributions

Feel free to contribute to this repository or suggest improvements!

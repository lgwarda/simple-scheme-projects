; Both 1 and 2 are legal sentences. 1 because define-struct is followed by a single variable name and 
; 2 since child, parents, dob, and date are variables and the parentheses are placed according to
; the grammatical pattern. 3 doesn't contain a single variable name and parentheses aren't
; according to  the gramatical pattern.

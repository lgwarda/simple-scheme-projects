(animate scene)

;Pixar Whomst?
;
;Goals: Use math (gasp) and conditional programming to make the animation better.
;
;Exercise 19 Use cond (or if if youâ€™re feeling cheeky)
;to make the circle grow and shrink in a loop instead of
;grow and suddenly dissapear and grow again.
;Since computing the radius is now a somewhat complex computation,
;it makes sense to write a seperate helper function which only computes the radius that scene calls.
;Hint: quotient, even?.

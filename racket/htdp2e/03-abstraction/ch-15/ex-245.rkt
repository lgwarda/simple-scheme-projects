; Develop the function=at-1.2-3-and-5.775? function. Given two functions from numbers
; to numbers, the function determines whether the two produce the same results for 1.2, 3,
; and -5.775.

; Mathematicians say that two functions are equal if they compute the same result when
; given the same inputâ€”for all possible inputs.

; Can we hope to define function=?, which determines whether two functions from numbers
; to numbers are equal? If so, define the function. If not, explain why and consider
; the implication that you have encountered the first easily definable idea for which
; you cannot define a function.
